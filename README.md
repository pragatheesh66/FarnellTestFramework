# FarnellTestFramework

*Cucumber framework for web automation*

- Implemented end to end automation framework using cucumber with TestNG in JAVA
- Implemented POM model and OOPs concepts 
- Detailed logger statements on step definitions has been Implemented

*********************** Below are the improvements that could be considered***********

JIRA integration can be done on framework to automatically update the test case status through script
Parallel execution can be Implemented to speed up the execution
External reports can be used such as Extent reports and Allure reports for detailed reporting
Test data can be handled from external files such Excel or CSV which is independent of scripting and maintanence could be more easier
Error or failures can be handled using Listerners which gives us a clear idea to come up with solutions
